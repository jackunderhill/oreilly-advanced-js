        // Q: Notice the difference between using one type of constructor to create all the books and using the genre property
        //    to distinguish between the type of book, and having multiple types of books (by using a different constructor for each book).
        //    Do we still need the genre property? Which method of creating books do you prefer?
        //    Can you see advantages of one way over the other? Again, add some comments to your code that describe this.

        // A: We don't really need the genre property now that there is a separate constuctor for each book genre,
        //    as we can just check for an 'instanceof' the genre. I prefer the previous method where we had a genre property, as overall,
        //    it took less code to implement. However if I knew there would be thousands of books created, it would be worth using
        //    this method to save the memory needed to create separate instances of the genre in each book object. So for scaling up an
        //    application, I can see the advantages of using genre-based constructors, even though it results in a few more lines of code.
